0.My name is Betty : This script changes User ID(su) and we need to change to betty id so we write  su betty. 

1.who am I : Here we are supposed to prints the effective userid of the current user, in our resources i found that 
"whoami" command does the acction we need but also i found a small guide(whoami: Print effective user id:
whoami prints the user name associated with the current effective user id. It is equivalent to the command `id -un'.)
that explains that there are two possible options, "whoami" and "id -un".

2.Groups: What we have to do here is simple, wrtie a script that prints all the groups the curren user is part of.
here we have two options, 1."groups" command that can be found ir our resources and 2. "id -Gn" that is in a external 
resource(http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/sh-utils_8.html). 

3-New Owner : We use "chown" to changes ownership of a file, so we use "chown betty hello". source:
