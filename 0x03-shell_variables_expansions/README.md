0. <o>:Create a script that creates an alias.here with use  the command `alias`, the result is `alias ls="rm *"`, [Source](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/).

2. The path to success is to take massive, determined action:Add /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.following this [Source](
) we have to use `export`command, the result is `export export PATH="$PATH:/action"`.

3. If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads:Create a script that counts the number of directories in the PATH.this one a har to explain but following the next structure will make sense,[Source](  
), the result is `echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n" | wc -l`.

4. Global variables: Create a script that lists environment variables.
`printenv`prints all or part of environment.[Source](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-list-all-environment-variables-env-command/).

5. Local variables: reate a script that lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
`set`command deas what we need, the resulta is `set`, [Source](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html)

6. Local variable:Create a script that creates a new local variable.

Name: BETTY
Value: Holberton

result : `BETTY="Holberton"`, 
[Source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-using-variables.htm).

7. Global variable:create a script that creates a new global variable.
Following this [Source](https://codeburst.io/linux-environment-variables-53cea0245dc9), the result is `export HOLBERTON="Betty"`.

8. Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power:rite a script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable TRUEKNOWLEDGE, followed by a new line.
Here we have to do a sum of our environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` with 128,following this [Source](https://www.shell-tips.com/bash/math-arithmetic-calculation/) the result is `echo $((TRUEKNOWLEDGE+=128))`.

9. Divide and rule:Write a script that prints the result of POWER divided by DIVIDE, followed by a new line.

POWER and DIVIDE are environment variables.
our sintaxys here is `echo $((myvar/myvar))`, following this [Source](https://www.shell-tips.com/bash/math-arithmetic-calculation/)
the result is echo `$((POWER/DIVIDE))`.

10. Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath:Write a script that

The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable BINARY
The script should display the number in base 10, followed by a new line
following this [Source](https://serviceitdirect.com/hex-octal-and-binary-shell-conversions), the sintaxys is `echo $(("number"#$BINARY))`then the result is `echo $((2#$BINARY))`.

12.Create a script that prints all possible combinations of two letters, except oo.

Letters are lower cases, from a to z
One combination per line
The output should be alpha ordered, starting with aa
Do not print oo
Your script file should contain maximum 64 characters

following this [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33177559/increment-a-letter-sequence-to-represent-a-whole-number-where-a-0-and-z-25), the result  will be `printf "%s\n" {a..z}{a..z} | grep -v "oo".

13.Write a script that prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line.

The number will be stored in the environment variable NUM.

following this [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13632001/how-to-display-number-to-two-decimal-places-in-bash-function),
the sintaxys is `printf "%0.2f\n"` and the environment variable `NUM`, the result is `printf "%.2f\n" $NUM`.

14.Write a script that converts a number from base 10 to base 16.

The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable DECIMAL
The script should display the number in base 16, followed by a new line
[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16527113/how-to-convert-decimal-to-hex-in-bash/16527169),
Result is `printf "%x\n" $DECIMAL`.
